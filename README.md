# Intensity-Analysis
Build your own model using NLP and Python<br>

<br>Steps to Follow<br>
<br>Data Collection<br>
Gather text data with labeled intensities from various sources.<br>
Ensure the dataset is diverse to cover different expressions of emotions.<br>
<br>Data Preprocessing<br>
<br>Clean the text data (remove noise, handle missing values).<br>
Tokenize the text, remove stop words, and perform lemmatization or stemming.<br>
Feature Engineering<br>
Extract features such as word counts, TF-IDF scores, sentiment scores, etc.<br>
Consider using pre-trained embeddings like Word2Vec or BERT for richer feature representation.<br>
Train/Test Split<br>
Split the data into training and testing sets (e.g., 80/20 split).<br>
Model Selection<br>
Experiment with different models like Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, and deep learning models like LSTM or BERT.<br>
Use cross-validation to select the best model.<br>
<br>Model Training<br>
Train the selected models on the training data.<br>
Monitor training performance and avoid overfitting.<br>
Model Evaluation<br>
Evaluate the models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score.<br>
Ensure the model achieves an accuracy of >85% on the test set.<br>
Hyperparameter Tuning<br>
Use techniques like Grid Search or Random Search to optimize hyperparameters.<br>
Fine-tune the model for better performance.<br>
Model Deployment<br>
Develop a plan to deploy the model in a production environment.<br>
Consider using platforms like Flask or FastAPI for creating an API.<br>
